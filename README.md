# My Thesis Document

Revisao:

  * o capitulo 3) esta pronto a ser revisto.


### ToDo's


**Low priority**

* Cover
  * change image
  * add examination committee

* Acknowledgments
  * add acknowledgments

* Abstract 
  * add english abstract
  * add portuguese abstract

* Table of Contents
  * verify desired TOC depth

* List of figures
  * check the convention for figure description

* List of tables
  * idem

* Acyonyms
  * add acronyms, and check convention when calling them



* Chapter 1 - Introduction
  * figure 1.1 
    - make sure it is complete
    - reduce its size

  * Objectives
    - review objectives

  * Document structure
    - add document structure

 

 * Chapter 2 - Literature Review
  * verify if an introduction is necessary
  * 2.2.1 - Exact Algorithms - review reference
  * 2.2.2.C - Tour improvement - remove citation
  * 2.2.3.A - Reinsert the SA metaheuristic procedure
  * 2.2.3.B - idem


* Chapter 3 - Problem formulation
  * verify if this chapter name is appropriate
  
* Chapter 4 - Optimization system 
  * justify why we will be using these two. 
  * maybe justify why optimum algorithms are not used. Cite google OR module + ILP TDTSP = slow to 7 cities.
  * rethink these images. they are crap. maybe even consider removing them.
  * if we still have space, add 2-opt to the heuristic optimization algorithms
  * review Simulated Annealing
  * **add the relevant citations whenever necessary**

* Chapter 5 - System Design
  * add introduction
  * review 5.1.2A - Data Management System
  * images from this subsection might be moved to annex
  * 5.1.2.b Optimization system - this makes sense to have here, but only if we just talk about the strategy. no implementation detals, just overall goals. fast algorithms. fast initial response because of user. after this optimize as much as possible.
  * figure 5.6 remove NN and MH connection.
  * 5.2 Design choices - if we are lacking space, this should be removed. The important parts should be moved to the relevant sections (if this is the case, Data collection and storage should be discussed in the DMS subsection)

* Chapter 6 - System Implementation
  * 6.1 - System architecture. Possibly replace image by a table (you can keep the icons tho)
  * 6.1.1 Underlying tech - change the order - django, node, react, heroku




* Overall notes
  * uniformize the tables
