### ToDo's


**Low priority**

* Cover
  * change image
  * add examination committee

* Acknowledgments
  * add acknowledgments

* Abstract 
  * add english abstract
  * add portuguese abstract

* Table of Contents
  * verify desired TOC depth

* List of figures
  * check the convention for figure description

* List of tables

  * Objectives
    - review objectives

  * Document structure
    - add document structure

 

 * Chapter 2 - Literature Review
  * verify if an introduction is necessary
  * 2.2.1 - Exact Algorithms - review reference
  * 2.2.2.C - Tour improvement - remove citation
  * 2.2.3.A - Reinsert the SA metaheuristic procedure
  * 2.2.3.B - idem


* Chapter 3 - Problem formulation
  * verify if this chapter name is appropriate

* Chapter 4 - Optimization system 
  * 4.1 - initial response - this probably should be moved somehwere. This is not a good way to start this chapter
  * maybe divide this section into heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms
  * justify why we will be using these two. 
  * maybe justify why optimum algorithms are not used. Cite google OR module + ILP TDTSP = slow to 7 cities.

* Chapter 5 - System Design
  * add introduction

* Chapter 6 - System Implementation
  * 6.2.3 - add screenshots of the app




* Overall notes
