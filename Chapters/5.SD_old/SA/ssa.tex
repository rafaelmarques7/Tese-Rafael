\todo{This introduction should be rethinked. 
goal? solve requests. 
How? 1)Collect the necessary information 2) optimize }


The Server Side Application (SSA) is the module responsible for finding a solution 
to a user request. In this case, the SSA receives a shallow Flying Tourist Problem,
that is, an instance of the problem which does not yet have the set of arcs $A$ associated to the problem.
Thus, the SSA has two main goals:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item create the list of arcs associated to the problem;
  \item produce a solution to the user selected request;
\end{enumerate}

The system which is responsible for producing the list of arcs will be denoted as \textit{Data Management System},

while the production of a solution to the user request relies on a system called \textit{Optimization System}.


\todo{Explain that the SSA consists in a way of translating user requests to FTP instances, which are than solved by the optimization algorithm previously deviced. Explain that, due to the multiple objectives of the system, we construct multiple cost matrixes for each objective function.}
