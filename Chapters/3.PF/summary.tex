\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary_pf}

This chapter enabled the definition of a problem (FTP) which is adequate for the characterization of both simple and complex trips. The instantiation of this problem requires a weight matrix where each of its entries corresponds to a single flight. This problem was shown to be a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem and thus, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Due to its computational complexity, the methodologies proposed to solve the problem rely on heuristic and metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
