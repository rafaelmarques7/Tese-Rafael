This section introduces the considered optimization algorithms to produce a solution to a Flying Tourist Problem, as defined in section \ref{sec:ftp}. Given the real-world application under development, and its goals, the devised optimization system should be capable of providing a stream of responses in finite-time. Due to these objectives, the considered optimization strategies are based on heuristic algorithms (subsection \ref{sec:heuristic}) and meta heuristics algorithms (subsection \ref{sec:meta}), as the characteristics of these algorithms fit the goals of the system.
