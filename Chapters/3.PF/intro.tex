As refered in chapter \ref{chap:introduction} the main goal of this work is to develop an application to solve unconstrained multi-city flight requests. However, this is not the only goal. The developed application should also be capable of solving simple requests, in particular, one-way and round-trip flights. In order to develop a system capable of addressing both simple and complex requests, we will formally introduce, in section \ref{sec:ftp}, a problem definition called the Flying Tourist Problem (FTP). In section \ref{sec:ftp_tsp} it will be shown that the FTP occurs as a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem, and it is thus NP-hard. In its turn, section \ref{sec:ftp_graph} shows how to construct a graph to represent this problem. Finally, the optimization strategy to solve the proposed problem is discussed in section \ref{chap:os}.
