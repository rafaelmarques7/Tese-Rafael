As referred to in chapter \ref{chap:introduction}, the main goal of this work is to develop an application to solve unconstrained multi-city flight requests, as well as simpler flight requests, such as the one-way and round-trip flights. In order to develop a system capable of addressing both simple and complex requests, we will formally introduce, in section \ref{sec:ftp}, a problem definition called the Flying Tourist Problem (FTP). In section \ref{sec:ftp_tsp} it will be shown that the FTP occurs as a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem, and it is thus NP-hard. In its turn, section \ref{sec:ftp_graph} shows how to construct a graph to represent this problem. Finally, section \ref{chap:os} presents the  strategies to solve the problem, which include both heuristic and metaheuristic optimization algorithms (subsection \ref{sec:heuristic} and \ref{sec:meta}, respectively).
