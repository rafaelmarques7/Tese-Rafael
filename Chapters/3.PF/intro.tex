The main goal of this work is to develop an online application to solve unconstrained multi-city flight requests. However, this is not the only goal. The developed application should also be capable of solving simple requests, in particular, single and round flights. In order to develop a system capable of addressing both simple and complex requests, we will formally introduce a problem definition, called Flying Tourist Problem (FTP), in section \ref{sec:ftp}. In section \ref{sec:ftp_tsp} it will be shown that the FTP occurs as a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem, and is thus NP-hard. Finally, section \ref{sec:ftp_graph} shows how to construct a graph to represent this problem.
