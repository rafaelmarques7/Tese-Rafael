This chapter introduces the optimization algorithms developed in order to produce a solution to a Flying Tourist Problem, as defined in section \ref{sec:ftp}. 
Given the real-world application under development, and its goals, the devised optimization system should be capable of providing a stream of responses in finite-time. Due to this objectives, the proposed optimization algorithms are heuristic, section \ref{sec:heuristic} and meta heuristics, section \ref{sec:meta}, as the characteristics of these algorithms fit the goals of the system.
