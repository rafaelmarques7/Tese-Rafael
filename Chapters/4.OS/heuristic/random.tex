\subsection{Pseudo-random construction procedure}
\label{sec:pseudo_random}

The method introduced in this subsection is not an optimization algorithm, but rather a solution construction procedure for the Flying Tourist Problem. This procedure is relevant for two reasons. First, it can be used to construct a solution to a request in a very fast manner. Of course, the quality of this solution may be extremely poor, but it is very useful as an initial and fast response to a user request. 
Furthermore, this construction procedure is also relevant, because some optimization algorithms, like the Simulated Annealing discussed in section \ref{sec:sa}, require an initial valid and complete solution.

The method introduced below will be hereinafter called pseudo-random construction procedure, and requires an instance of the Flying Tourist Problem $G=(Vc,A,T_0,D,TW)$ where there are no restrictions regarding the time-windows, that is $TW(i) = [0, +\infty[$, $\forall i \in V$. Note that this procedure is both adequate for single and round flights, as well as FTP instances with many nodes to visit. The procedure can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item set an initial empty solution: $s=()$;
    \item set the current time to one of the possible start dates: $t \in T_0=[T_{0i}, T_{0f}]$;
    \item set the current node to the start node: $v_c = v_0$;
    \item if the set of nodes to visit, $V$, is empty, go to step 11); else, continue to step 5)
    \item select the next node by choosing a random node from the set of nodes to visit: $v_i \in V$;
    \item remove the selected node from the set of nodes to visit: $V=V\backslash\{v_i\}$;
    \item extend the solution with the arc: $a_{v_c, v_i}^t$;
    \item increment the time according to the duration of visit of the selected node: $t=t+d(v_i)$;
    \item update the current node: $v_c=v_i$;
    \item go to step 4);
    \item extend the solution with the final arc $a_{v_c, v_{n=1}}^t$;
\end{enumerate}
