% Despite the existence of numerous flight search applications, most of them lack the ability to properly address multi-city flight requests. The goal of this work is to develop an application that addresses the problem of finding the best route, schedule and set of flights, for any unconstrained multi-city flight request. 

% The considered problem belongs to the class of scheduling and routing problems. In particular, it occurs as a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem and its time-dependent variation. Thus, an overview of the methodologies implemented in the resolution of these problems may be useful for the definition of an adequate strategy to the resolution of the considered problem. 

% This work proposes a formal definition for the problem under resolution, and denotes it as the Flying Tourist Problem. In order to solve it, this work uses different heuristics and metaheuristics, including the Ant Colony Optimization and the Simulated Annealing. Using these methods, a solution may be constructed in real-time, even for large problem instances.

% The methods developed for the resolution of this problem are integrated into a web application, making it publicly available.

% The developed system is evaluated using three different criteria: the quality of its optimization system; the utility of the devised problem; and its performance compared to other similar systems. The results are extremely positive, and show that it is possible to
% considerable reduce the price and flight duration, even for small problem instances. 


%The presented work has two main goals:•  The study of the unconstrained multi-city flight routing problem, and the development of an effectiveoptimization strategy to address the problem;•  This should be complemented with the development of a web application that integrates a solutionto the aforementioned problem.The first goal of this work can be addressed by studying similar routing problems, as is the TravelingSalesman Problem.

\section{Conclusions}

The present work was developed with the intention of simplifying the planning and scheduling of complex trips. In particular, its main goal is to find the best schedule, route and set of flights, for any given flight request. This includes the resolution of the unconstrained multi-city flight routing problem.

Despite the proximity to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the problem under resolution has several attributes that differentiate it from the TSP and its time-dependent variation. These differences led us to propose a formal definition of the problem, denoted the Flying Tourist Problem (FTP), that better describes the characteristics of the problem under resolution.

In order to solve the problem in an efficient manner, the present work proposes different optimization strategies that address different goals. The first goal relates to the ability of the system to present an initial solution in a very short time. This is achieved by implementing simple heuristics, such as the nearest neighbour. The second goal considers the ability of the system to produce high quality solutions. To achieve this, this work implements two different meta-heuristic optimization algorithms: the Ant Colony Optimization and the Simulated Annealing. The final goal of the system is to produce different solutions to different objective functions. To achieve this, optimization process multiple times, using different representations of the problem, according to the objective function under consideration.

The present work also considers an analysis of the quality of the solutions constructed by the different optimization algorithms. The analysis of these results show that the developed meta-heuristics present much higher quality solutions than those provided by simpler heuristics, such as the nearest neighbour. This improvement is modest for very small instances (3) nodes, but is significant for instances of medium and large size (5-20 nodes).

The discussion presented above lead to the conclusion that the developed system achieves its main goals. First of all, it is successful in the resolution of unconstrained multi-city flight requests. Second, the developed application is successful in the integration of the proposed solution.
This, together with the analysis of the success rate of the different optimization algorithms, leads us to the conclusion that the devised system is successful in the resolution of the FTP, and is capable of saving time and money in the planning and scheduling of trips of different sizes and complexities.

\section{Future work}

%The present work integrates a solution to the FTP request


%Given the present work, there are two ways to contribute to future inovation. 

%This work was developed with the intent to simplify the planning and scheduling of big and often complex trips. This led to the definition of a problem that addresses travelling using commercial flights only.
%However, commercial flights are only one of the many transportation systems. The proposed problem may be integrated with other public transports, as bus and railroad services.

%Given the goal, any idea that extends the search utilities of the given system may be worth exploring. 
%It would be particularly interesting to see a system that integrates different transportation systems in the resolution of complex trips.  

%The utility of the developed system can be extended by integrating different public transportation systems, as bus and railroad services.

%Given the present work, and considering the goal of simplifying the resolution of complex trips, there are several ways to contribute to development of better search tools:

Given the present work, and considering the goal of developing better search tools for the planning and scheduling of complex trips, there are some interesting extensions and possible improvements to the developed system:

\begin{itemize}
    %This would extend the flight search with other options, such as bus and railroad services;
    
    \item The developed optimization system is implemented using Python3. There could be significant speedups by rewriting this module in a language like C++.
    
    \item 
    %During the resolution of a FTP requests, the bottleneck of the system is usually the  the collection of the necessary flight data
    It is necessary to device a more efficient way to collect the flight data necessary for the resolution of a FTP requests. For big instances, the bottleneck of the system is usually the data collection process, and not the actual optimization.
    
    \item Finally, it would be particularly useful and interesting to extend the developed system by considering different public  transportation systems, such as bus and railroad services, in the resolution of the proposed routing problem. This would extend the search space of the problem, and possibly contribute to the construction of better itineraries, and solutions to the requests.
    %and possibly introduce new optimal solutions.
