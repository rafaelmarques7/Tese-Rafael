\section{Objectives}

% The main goal of this work is to develop a solution to the unconstrained multi-city flight routing problem. This will be accomplished by studying similar problems and the optimization strategies that are typically used to address these problems. 

% Furthermore, a secondary goal is to develop a web application, that works as a flight search-engine, and that implements the proposed solution as to solve complex routing problems 

% The goal of this work is to study the unconstrained multi-city flight routing problem, and to develop a system to address it.

The presented work has two main goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The study of the unconstrained multi-city flight routing problem, and the development of an effective optimization strategy to address the problem;
    \item This should be complemented with the development of a web application that integrates a solution to the aforementioned problem.
\end{itemize}

The first goal of this work can be accomplished by studying similar routing problems, as is the Traveling Salesman Problem. This should provide the theoretical background necessary to better understand the problem, and to developed and implement the necessary optimization algorithms to solve it. Finally, to address the second goal, it is necessary to develop the necessary tools to create a web application, and integrate it with the optimization solution devised for the resolution of the problem.

















% In order to address the first goal of this work, it will be necessary to study problems that are closely related to the one under , as well as the optimization strategies that are typically used to solve them. This must be followed by the implementation of a system that addresses the problem

% In its turn, the second goal of this work will be accomplished by developing the web application  


% This work intends to study the time-dependent traveling salesman problem and develop an algorithm
% to present high quality solutions in a short period of time. This algorithm is to be used 
% in the development of an online flight search application capable of finding the best flights 
% for a trip composed of several cities, with no particular routing constraints. 
% The concretization of this search engine requires a user interface to collect trip requests,
% and both access to real time flight data, and to an optimization
% algorithm capable of solving the TDTSP instance.

% Furthermore, a secondary objective is to develop a search engine capable of solving 
% multi-objective tsp instances. This is believed to be important, because many users care not only about the flight price,
% but other attributes, as the flight duration.

% Finally, the search options of the developed search engine should include the possibility
% to constrain one particular city to a specific time window. The objective of this is to study 
% the possibility of using the developed algorithm to solve constrained problems,
% as is the TDTSP with time windows.
