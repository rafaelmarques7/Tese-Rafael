\section{Objectives}

This work intends to study the time-dependent traveling salesman problem and develop an algorithm
to present high quality solutions in a short period of time. This algorithm is to be used 
in the development of an online flight search application capable of finding the best flights 
for a trip composed of several cities, with no particular routing constraints. 
The concretization of this search engine requires a user interface to collect trip requests,
and both access to real time flight data, and to an optimization
algorithm capable of solving the TDTSP instance.

Furthermore, a secondary objective is to develop a search engine capable of solving 
multi-objective tsp instances. This is believed to be important, because many users care not only about the flight price,
but other attributes, as the flight duration.

Finally, the search options of the developed search engine should include the possibility
to constrain one particular city to a specific time window. The objective of this is to study 
the possibility of using the developed algorithm to solve constrained problems,
as is the TDTSP with time windows.
