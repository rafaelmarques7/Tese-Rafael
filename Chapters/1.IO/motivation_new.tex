\section{Motivation}

Online Traveling Agencies (OTA) are online applications which sell traveling goods, 
as, for example, commercial flight tickets.
Although consumers retain the option to buy flights directly from airline companies,
the majority chooses to use OTA.
The main reason for this is that these agencies aggregate flight data 
from multiple airlines, instead of being limited to a single one, 
which ultimately increases the options of the consumer.
Furthermore, many OTA work as meta-search engines, searching over a variety of websites
in order to find the best flights which satisfy the consumer requirements.
While OTA usually provide very complete search functionalities for simple flights,
the majority fails to offer the same search options for a trip composed of multiple cities. 

Consider a trip starting and ending at any given city,
which must visit every city specified in a particular list of cities. 
If there are no constraints associated with the order in which these cities must be visited, 
this problem is known, in the scientific community, 
as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This problem 
is considered very difficult to solve, since the total number 
of possible solutions increases in an exponential way, as the number of cities increases.

If commercial flights are the means of transportation between every pair of cities,
this problem can no longer be considered the \textit{classic} Traveling Salesman,
but rather its \textit{time-dependent} counterpart. This is because
some of the major flight characteristics, as its price and duration,
cannot be considered constant over time. Rather, they are dependent on the particular flight selected, 
and the characteristics of that flight may follow no
apparent logical rule, at least from the consumers perspective.

Consequently, finding the most efficient set of flights, from the consumer point of view,
is a very repetitive and time-consuming task. Faced with this problem, only the most 
persistent consumer will be able to find the best solution for the problem, and this can only 
occur for a very small list of cities. As the number of cities increases,
even the most persistent consumer cannot verify all possible solutions.
This means that, ultimately, the final consumer will pay more than necessary for the requested service.

This work also arises as a response to the public contest called \textit{Traveling Salesman Challenge} \cite{tsc_kiwi},
issued by \textit{Kiwi}, a well established OTA, even though the beginning of this work dates prior to the issue of the challenge.
In this challenge, Kiwi recognizes that, in most cases, users do not care about the order in which they visit 
a given list of cities, and that there exists a market niche interested in this type of services.
Kiwi also recognizes that most OTA do not offer these type of services due to the computational 
complexity associated with the problem.

This work intends to address the problem of solving multi-city trips, by studying it, and by developing 
the necessary technologies to effectively solve the problem in a time-efficient manner.
It also wishes to develop a proof of concept online flight search application, 
implementing these technologies in order to, ultimately, provide high-quality search
for multi-city trips.
