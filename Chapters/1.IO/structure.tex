\section{Document structure}

The presented work can be divided into two main parts: the study of the unconstrained multi-city routing problem, and the implementation of a web application that integrates a solution to this problem. Thus, this document is structured as follows.

Chapter 2 presents a literature review on problems that are closely related to the one under study, in particular, the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Chapter 3 presents a formal definition of the problem and defines the optimization strategies that will be implemented to solve it.

Chapter 4 presents the development and implementation details of a web application that allows the resolution of unconstrained multi-city flight requests. This is achieved by implementing the  previously mentioned optimization strategies to solve the user requests.  

Chapter 5 evaluates the implemented system, by analyzing the performance of its different parts, and the utility of the developed solution as a whole.

Finally, Chapter 6 presents the main conclusions of this work, and addresses the future work that may improve the developed solution with further utilities.
