\section{Initial Response}
\label{sec:initial_response}

\todo{Do not start like this. INitial responnse?! We have to definew what we want. We have to define how to get it. And we have to see the advantages and disadvantages of each of the porposed solutions. Also, we want to define what is important. From the user pov. We also need to explain how this affects our choices. This chapter structure should be. 1) Goals, 2) How 3) Why}

\todo{Insert heuristics like NN, two opt, random too.}

\todo{If possible, find out the polynomial time of each of the constructed algorithms.}
