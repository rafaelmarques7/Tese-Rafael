Following the architecture proposed in section \ref{sec:optimization_design},
the optimization system will produce a stream of responses to the user request.
To produce a fast response, a simple random solution will be generated initially.
This is followed with the application of the nearest neighbour heuristic,
and concluses with the execution of two meta-heuristic algorithms: the Ant Colony Optimization
and Simmulated Annealing.
