Every CSA request may be defined as a FTP instance, as proposed in section \ref{sec:ftp}. Thus, each request is described by a limited number of attributes (origin, start date, etc.),  and it may be uniquely identified according to its uniform resource identifier (URI). 
%In order to uniquely identify a particular resource, 
%This means that the identification of a specific resource can be achieved by including each of these attributes in the uniform resource identifier.

Hence, each flight resource is described by a predefined list of pairs of keywords and values. This is illustrated in table  \ref{table:api_symbols}, where the first and second column represent a FTP variable name and symbol, respectively. In its turn, the third column defines the keyword for the URI, while the fourth column provides a description about the acceptable values for each keyword. 

It should be noted that the defined pairs of keywords and values must undergo a validation process, not only to verify if the values provided for each keyword are acceptable, but also to assert that the request is a valid FTP formulation.

%A flight resource may be described by an HTTP request to the API endpoint, together with the specification of the resource type ('/flights'), followed by the necessary attributes to describe the request. These attributes are grouped using a '\&' symbol, and do not require a specific order. Table \ref{table:api_symbols} specifies the possible request attributes, together with the keyword necessary to identify it, and the details and data type of each.
