The Server Side Application is the module that is responsible for producing a solution to a user request. The architecture and implementation details of the SSA are presented in section \ref{sec:api_architecture}. Each request processed by the SSA is defined by a set of parameters that specify the aimed trip, as will be described in section \ref{sec:api_protocol}. Producing a solution to a user request also involves the communication with third party API's, as to obtain the necessary flight data, which is handled by the Data Management System, described in section \ref{sec:dms_implementation}. The actual production of a solution is managed by the Optimization System, described in section \ref{sec:os_implementation}.
