While chapter \ref{chap:pf} presented a formal definition of the problem and proposed some methodologies to solve it, this chapter addresses the design choices and implementation details related to the development of a flight search application to solve unconstrained multi-city flight requests. It presents an overview of the architecture (section \ref{sec:system_architecture}), structure and design choices (subsections \ref{sec:csa_design} and \ref{sec:ssa_design}). It also presents the implementation details of the developed application. In particular, it describes the underlying technologies (section \ref{sec:sa_implementation}), the structure of the CSA (subsection \ref{sec:csa_implementation}) as well as the current user interface (subsection \ref{sec:user_interface_ready}), and the SSA API and DMS (section \ref{sec:ssa_implementation}).
