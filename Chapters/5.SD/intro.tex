One of the objectives addressed by this work is the development of a flight search application to solve unconstrained multi-city flight requests. Chapter \ref{chap:pf} presented a formal definition of the problem, and chapter \ref{chap:os} covered some possible ways to solve it. In its turn, this chapter presents an overview of the architecture (section \ref{sec:system_architecture}), structure and design choices (sections \ref{sec:csa_design} and \ref{sec:ssa_design}) of the proposed web application.
