The main goal of the proposed work is to develop a flight search application to solve unconstrained multi-city flight requests. Chapter \ref{chap:pf} presented a formal definition of the problem, and chapter \ref{chap:os} covered some of the possible ways to solve it. In its turn, this chapter presents an overview of the architecture (section \ref{sec:sa}), structure and design choices (sections \ref{sec:csa} and \ref{sec:ssa}) of the proposed web application.
