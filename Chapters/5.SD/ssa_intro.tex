The SSA is responsible for producing a solution to a user defined FTP instance. To do so, the SSA shall be implemented as an Application Programming Interface (API), listening for requests to particular resources, which uniquely identify these FTP instances. Each received request corresponds to a shallow FTP instance, that is, a problem in which the cities are specified, but the flights are not. To overcome this problem, and collect the relevant flight data, the SSA will rely on a \ac{DMS}, discussed in section \ref{sec:dms_design}. Having a complete FTP instance, the SSA will use the Optimization system discussed in section \ref{sec:os_design} to construct a solution to these user requests.
