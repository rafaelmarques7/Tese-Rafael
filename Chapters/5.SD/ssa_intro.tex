The server Side Application (SSA) is responsible for producing a solution to a user defined Flying Tourist Problem instance. To do so, the SSA is implemented as an Application Programming Interface (API), listening for requests to particular resources, which uniquely identify these FTP instances. However, each received request corresponds only to a shallow FTP instance, that is, a problem in which the cities are specified, but the flights are not. To overcome this problem, and collect the relevant flight data, the SSA relies on the Data Management System, discussed in section \ref{sec:dms_design}. Having a complete FTP instance, the SSA utilizes the Optimization system discussed in section \ref{sec:os_design} to construct a solution to these user requests.
