Django is a python framework for the development of web servers and APIs \cite{django}. During the development of this work, django was used to develop the SSA, by creating a web server to run an API to process requests from the CSA. This API, described with further detail in subsection \ref{sec:api_architecture}, interprets the requests using regular expression matching, following the protocol defined in subsection \ref{sec:api_protocol}. Upon interpreting the request, it is possible to execute particular sets of functions, as the flight data requests to third party APIs, and the optimization algorithms to solve the FTP requests.
