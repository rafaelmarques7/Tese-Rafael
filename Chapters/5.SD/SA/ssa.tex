The Server Side Application (SSA) is the module responsible for creating a solution 
to a user selected request. In this case, the SSA receives a shallow Flying Tourist Problem,
that is, an instance of the problem which does not yet have the set of arcs $A$ associated to the problem.
Thus, the SSA has two main goals:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item create the list of arcs associated to the problem;
  \item produce a solution to the user selected request;
\end{enumerate}

The system which is responsible for producing the list of arcs will be denoted as \textit{Data Management System},
while the production of a solution to the user request relies on a system called \textit{Optimization System}.
