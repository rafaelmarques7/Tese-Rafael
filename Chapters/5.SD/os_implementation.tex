\section{Optimization system}
\label{sec:os_implementation}

Given a FTP request, the Optimization System (OS) is the module that constructs the respective solutions, using the strategies described in subsection \ref{sec:os_design}. This module is constructed using the Python3 programming language, and uses the \textit{numpy} library \cite{numpy} for the construction and the management of the multi-dimensional (and often large) arrays, which describe an FTP instance.
