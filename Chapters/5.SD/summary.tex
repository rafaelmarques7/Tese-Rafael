\label{sec:summary_sd}

This chapter presented the design and implementation details of the proposed flight search web application. In the first part, covering the sections related to the design process, it was presented the considered architecture for the web application, which separates the user interface from the logic associated to the resolution of FTP requests. It also established a design goal for the user interface, and proposed an architecture for the optimization algorithm, as to reduce the latency that is sensed by the users. During the remaining of the chapter, the implementation details regarding these topics were provided.
