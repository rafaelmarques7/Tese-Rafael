%This chapter presents a review on the literature around Combinatorial Optimization, the Traveling Salesman Problem and its time-dependent variation, including the presentation of the state of the art of the algorithms which address these problems.

The problem that this work wishes to address, and which will be formally introduced as the \ac{FTP} in chapter \ref{chap:pf}, is closely related to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Both of these problems belong to broader classes of optimization problems, particularly, \acp{COP} and Routing problems. This chapter will start by introducing the concept of Combinatorial Optimization Problems in section \ref{sec:sec_2.1} and, in particular, the Traveling Salesman Problem  and the Vehicle Routing Problem in subsections \ref{sec:sec_tsp} and \ref{sec:sec_vrp}, respectively. This is followed by an overview of the most common methods to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, presented in section \ref{sec:sec_2.2}.
