\subsubsection{Held-Karp Lower Bound}

In some cases, the quality of a heuristic solution can not be directly calculated,
as no exact solution for the problem under consideration is known.
In this cases, it is important to have a way of evaluating performance.
The standart way of doing this is by comparing the heuristic solutions
which the solution generated by the Held-Karp (HK) lower bound, \cite{held_karp_lb}.

The HK lower bound is the solution to the linear programming relaxation of
the ILP formulation of the TSP. This solution can be found in polynomial time for moderate instance sizes..
However, for a very large problem,
solving the relaxed problem directly is not feasible. In this cases, Held and Karp
prose an interative algorithm in order to approximate the solution. This methods
involves computing a large number of minimum spanning trees.
This iterative version of the algorithm will often keep the solution
within $0.01\%$ of the HK lower bound, \cite{heuristics_tsp}.
