In some particular cases, exact algorithms can not be used in the resolution of the TSP instance under consideration. This usually occurs when dealing with very large instances, or when there is an urgency in obtaining solutions in a very fast manner. In these cases, using approximation algorithms may be a good choice. These algorithms are not guaranteed to produce an optimal solution,
however, with a good heuristic, approximation algorithms produce high quality solutions in a reasonable time. Generally, the heuristic may be classified as one of two classes: construction or improvement heuristics \cite{heuristics_tsp}.

When an optimal solution is not known, measuring the heuristic performance of a method may be difficult. In this cases, the heuristic evaluation can be done by comparison with the Held-Karp lower bound.

Heuristic algorithms are usually specifically designed for a particular optimization problem. For example, the Lin-Kernighan Heuristic was created to solve the symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem, and does not seam to have useful applications in other combinatorial optimization problems.
