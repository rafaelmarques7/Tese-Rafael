In some cases, exact algorithms can not be used in the resolution of the TSP instance under consideration. This usually occurs when dealing with very large instances, or when there is an urgency in obtaining solutions in a very fast manner. In these cases, the usage of approximation algorithms may be a good choice. These algorithms are not guaranteed to produce an optimal solution,
however, with a good heuristic, approximation algorithms produce high quality solutions in a reasonable time. Generally, the heuristic may be classified as one of two classes: construction or improvement heuristics \cite{heuristics_tsp}.
