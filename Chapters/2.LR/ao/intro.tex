The algorithms which address the Traveling Salesman, and any Combinatorial Optimization problem for that matter,
can be classified as exact, heuristic or meta-heuristic.
Exact algorithms are thus which always provide an optimal solution to the problem.
Although these might seem the first choice, exact algorithms are usually inefficient for solving large problems.
In its turn, heuristic algorithms intend to be efficient, abdicating the objective 
of finding the best solution, and focusing on finding \textit{near-optimal} solutions in a short time.
Heuristic algorithms are usually problem specific,
while Meta-heuristics algorithms are designed in such a way that they can be used 
for a variety of Combinatorial Optimization problems, in a fast and efficient way.
