The algorithms that address the Traveling Salesman and other Combinatorial Optimization problems, can be classified as exact, heuristic or meta-heuristic. Some of the algorithms belonging to each of these three classes will be discussed in subsection \ref{sec:exact-algorithms}, \ref{sec:heuristic-algorithms} and \ref{sec:metaheuristic-algorithms}, respectively. Exact algorithms are those which always provide an optimal solution to the problem. Although these might seem the first choice, exact algorithms are usually inefficient for solving large problems. In its turn, heuristic algorithms intend to be efficient, handing over the objective of finding the best solution, and focusing on finding \textit{near-optimal} solutions in a short time. Heuristic algorithms are usually problem specific, while Meta-heuristics algorithms are designed in such a way that they can be used for a variety of Combinatorial Optimization problems, in a fast and efficient way.
