There are some exact algorithms available for the Traveling Salesman Problem, \cite{tsp_exact_review},
including its time-dependent variations, \cite{tdtwptw_exact}, and even 
with time windows, \cite{tsptw_soloman}. These algorithms usually require 
the problem to be formulated as an Integer Linear Programming Instance.
In this section we present ILP definitions for both the classical time-dependent TSP.
We also present a brienf introduction regarding the Branch and Bound algorithm,
which has proven to be very useful for determining exact, or at most, near optimal solutions
for the TSP. The software \textit{Concorde}, uses a Branch and Bound algorithm,
and was used to solve all 110 instances of the TSPLib, reporting exact solutions in every problem,
including a instance with 89.900 nodes, although it required more than 110 CPU years.
