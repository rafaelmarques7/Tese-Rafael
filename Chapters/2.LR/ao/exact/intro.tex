There are multiple exact algorithms available for the Traveling Salesman Problem, \cite{tsp_exact_review}, including its time-dependent \cite{tdtwptw_exact} and time windows \cite{tsptw_exact_soloman} variations. These algorithms usually require the problem to be formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) instance. In this section, we present ILP definitions for both the classic and the time-dependent TSP. We also present a brief introduction regarding the Branch and Bound algorithm, often used to determine optimal or near optimal solutions.
