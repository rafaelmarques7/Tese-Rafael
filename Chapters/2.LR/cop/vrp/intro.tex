The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is the problem of finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles, to serve a given set of customers. The VRP is believed to have been introduced by Dantzig, in 1959, in a work en tilted \textit{The Truck Dispatching Problem} \cite{truck_problem_dantzig}. Later, it was shown that the VRP, being a generalization of the TSP, also belongs to the NP-hard class \cite{VRP_complexity}. 

Being an NP-hard problem, the focus of the research usually revolves around heuristic algorithms, although there are some procedures which are known to produce optimal solutions (\cite{VRP_exact_heuristic}, \cite{TDVRP_exact}). As referred by Donati in \cite{MACS_VRPTW}, citing the work of Blum \cite{blum_complexity},
even when an exact procedure is available, it usually requires large computational time, which is not viable in the time-scale of hours, as is required by the industry. 

In 1192, Malandraki \cite{TDVRP_92} stated that the assumption of constant and deterministic costs is an approximation of the actual conditions of routing problems, and thus, a time-dependent formulation of the problem should be considered. In 1999, Gambardella and colleagues proposed a multi ant colony system for solving the vehicle routing problems using a meta-heuristic approach \cite{MACS_VRPTW}. Years later, Gambardella expanded this research to include time-dependent variations, \cite{TDVRP_multi_objective_aco}, as proposed by \cite{TDVRP_92}. There are several other works, which propose meta-heuristic solutions to solve the time-dependent VRP, \cite{VRP_meta}, including the use of simulated annealing \cite{tdvrp_costs}, and genetic algorithms \cite{TDVRP_GA}. 

The rest of this section is structured as follows. Subsection \ref{sec:vrp_classic} presents a formal definition of the Vehicle Routing Problem. Its time-dependent and multi-objective variations are covered, respectively, in subsection \ref{sec:time-dependent-vrp} and \ref{sec:multi-objetive-vrp}. Since the TSP occurs only as a generalization of the non-capacitated vehicle routing problem,
the capacitated vehicle routing is out of the scope of this work.
