\subsubsection{Multi-objective VRP}
\label{sec:multi-objetive-vrp}

Multi objective optimization corresponds to the resolution of a combinatorial optimization problem
in which more than one goals are defined. In the case of the Vehicle Routing Problem, \cite{multi_objective_vrp},
the most common objectives include minimizing the fleet size, the total distance traveled,
the total time required, the total tour cost, and/or maxizimizing the quality of the service
or the profit collected. Note that in most problems, when multiple objectives are identified,
the different objectives often conflict with each other.

Multi-objective optimization usually relies on the use of meta-heuristics, \cite{multi-objective-meta}.
There are several works focusing on this problem, and the most promising meta-heuristics 
for multi-objective optimization include Evolutionary Optimization, \cite{eo_multi_objective} and Simmulated Annealing, \cite{sa_multi_objective}.
There is also some work considering the Ant Colony Optimization.
In particular, a modified ant colony was designed to solve a bi-objective time dependent
vehicle routing problem, in which the main goal was the minimization of the fleet size,
followed by the minimization of the total cost, \cite{TDVRP_multi_objective_aco}.
