\subsubsection{Multi objective TSP}
\label{sec:multi-objective-tsp}

The multi objective Traveling Salesman problem is a generalization 
of the classic TSP, and is part of much broader class of problems, 
the multi objective combinatorial optimization problems, \cite{multi_objective_cop},
and, in particular, multi objective vehicle routing problems, \cite{multi_objective_vrp}.

The Multi objective TSP is defined as follows \cite{moea_for_motsp}:

Given a list of $n$ cities and a set D = $(D_1, D_2, ..., D_k)$ of $n*n$ weight matrix,
the objective is to minimize $f(\pi) = (f_1(\pi), f_2(\pi), ..., f_k(\pi))$,
with $f_i(\pi) = (\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} d_{\pi(j),\pi(j+1)}^i) + d_{\pi(n), \pi(1)}^i$,
where $\pi$ is a permutation over the set (1, 2, ..., n). 

Note that when $ D = (D_1)$, this corresponds to single-objective TSP.
Note also that the above formulation considers that all objective functions calculate the weight 
of the hamiltionian cycle, according to the respective weight matrix.

The quality of the results of the multi objective TSP are usually measured 
according to its performance accross the Pareto criteria, defined as follows \cite{pareto}:

\textbf{Pareto dominance}

A vector $\vec{u} = (u_1, ..., u_k)$ is said to dominate $\vec{v} = (v_1, ..., v_k)$,
deonted by $\vec{u} \preceq \vec{v}$, if and only if $\vec{u}$ is partially less than $\vec{v}$,
i.e. $\forall i \in \{1, ..., k\} u_i \leq v_i \land \exists i \in {1,...,k}: u_i < v_i$.

\textbf{Pareto Optimality}

Pareto optimality is defined asa concept of allocation optimality. An allocation 
is not pareto optimal if there is at least one alternative allocation which produces improvements 

A solution $x \in \Omega$ is said to be Pareto optimal with respect to $\Omega$
iff. there is no $x^{'} \in \Omega$ for which $\vec{v}=F(x^{'})=(f_1(x^{'}), ...,f_k(x^{'}))$ 
dominates $\vec{u}=F(x)=(f_1(x), ...,f_k(x))$.

\textbf{Pareto Optimal Set}

For a given MOP $F(x)$, the Paretto optimal set $(P*)$ is defined as :
$P* = \{ x \in \Omega | \not \exists x^{'} \in \Omega : F(x^{'}) \preceq F(x) \}  $


Althoug the above mentioned problem refers to the multi-objective TSP,
without loss of generality, the multi-objective optimization can be performed on a time-dependent TSP.
There is very few direct research about multi objective Time dependent TSP,
but one can cite \cite{multi_objective_machine_sequencing},
which proposes a multi-objective tabu search for single machine scheduling problems 
with sequence-dependent setup times.
