\subsubsection{Multi-objective TSP}
\label{sec:multi-objective-tsp}

The multi-objective Traveling Salesman problem is a generalization of the classic TSP, and is part of much broader class of problems, comprehending the multi objective combinatorial optimization problems \cite{multi_objective_cop} and, in particular, the multi objective vehicle routing problems \cite{multi_objective_vrp}.

The multi objective TSP is defined as follows \cite{moea_for_motsp}:

Given a list of $n$ cities and a set D = $(D_1, D_2, ..., D_k)$ of $n*n$ weight matrices, the objective is to minimize $f(\pi) = (f_1(\pi), f_2(\pi), ..., f_k(\pi))$, with $f_i(\pi) = (\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} d_{\pi(j),\pi(j+1)}^i) + d_{\pi(n), \pi(1)}^i$, where $\pi$ is a permutation over the set (1, 2, ..., n). 

Note that when $ D = (D_1)$, this corresponds to the single-objective TSP. Note also that the above formulation considers that all objective functions calculate the weight of the Hamiltonian cycle, according to the respective weight matrix.

The quality of the results of the multi objective TSP are usually measured  according to its performance across the Pareto criteria, defined as follows \cite{pareto}:


\textbf{Pareto dominance}

A vector $\vec{u} = (u_1, ..., u_k)$ is said to dominate $\vec{v} = (v_1, ..., v_k)$, denoted by $\vec{u} \preceq \vec{v}$, if and only if $\vec{u}$ is partially less than $\vec{v}$, i.e. $\forall$ $i$ $\in$ $\{1, ..., k\}$ $u_i$ $\leq$ $v_i$ $\land$ $\exists$ $i$ $\in$ ${1,...,k}:$ $u_i$ $<$ $v_i$.


\textbf{Pareto Optimality}

Pareto optimality is defined as a concept of allocation optimality. An allocation is not Pareto optimal if there is at least one alternative allocation which produces improvements.

A solution $x \in \Omega$ is said to be Pareto optimal with respect to $\Omega$ if, and only if, there is no $x^{'} \in \Omega$ for which $\vec{v}=F(x^{'})=(f_1(x^{'}), ...,f_k(x^{'}))$ dominates $\vec{u}=F(x)=(f_1(x), ...,f_k(x))$.


\textbf{Pareto Optimal Set}

For a given multi-objective problem $F(x)$, the Pareto optimal set $(P*)$ is defined as :

$P* = \{ x \in \Omega | \neg \exists x^{'} \in \Omega : F(x^{'}) \preceq F(x) \}$


Although the above mentioned problem refers to the multi-objective TSP, without loss of generality, the multi-objective optimization can be performed on a time-dependent TSP. There is very few direct research about multi objective time dependent TSP, but one can cite \cite{multi_objective_machine_sequencing}, which proposes a multi-objective tabu search for single machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setup times.
