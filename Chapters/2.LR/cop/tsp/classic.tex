\subsubsection{Problem definition}
\label{sec:classic_tsp}

The Traveling Salesman occurs both as combinatorial optimization and as a Graph Problem.
In either case, the TSP is defined by a graph $G = (N, A)$, where $N$ is the set of 
nodes, and $A$ is the set of arcs connecting those nodes.
The set of nodes is of size $n = |N|$, while the size of the set of arcs is $m = |N|^2$.
Each arc, $a_{ij}, i, j \in N, i \ne j$ has an associated weight, $c_{ij}$, which represents, for example, the distance between cities.
The set of arcs is fully connected, that is, each node is capable of reaching any other node directly, without visiting a third node.
When two nodes can not be connected by an arc, the cost of that node is considered as very high.
In the classical TSP formulation, the graph is undirected, which implies symmetry in the costs of the arcs, that is: $c_{ij} = c_{ji} \forall i, j \in N$.
Because of the characteristics of this TSP formulation, the graph is said to be connected, weighted and undirected.

The objective of the TSP is to find the minimum cost Hamiltonian cycle, that is a path which visits each node exactly once, and returns to the initial node, closing the path.
A generic solution to the TSP is any permutation $\sigma$ over the set of nodes, $N$. 
$\sigma$ is also a set, where $\sigma_{i}, i \in len(\sigma)$, represents the node in the i'th index of the cycle.
The cost of a cycle is given by the sum of the weights of each arc by which it is composed,
that is $C(\sigma) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{\sigma_{i} \sigma_{i+1}}$, where $\sigma_{n+1} = \sigma_{1}$

The TSP can solve diferent types of problems by optimising different parameters. In the classic formulation,
the weight between of an arc connecting two nodes represent the distance between two cities. However, the weight
of an arc can represent different things, particularly, travel time or travel cost. Althoug changing the parameter
may lead the TSP formulation intact, in some cases, it changes the problem. 
This occurs for example when considering that costs are time-dependent and this will be approached in section $\ref{sec:time-dependent-tsp}$.
