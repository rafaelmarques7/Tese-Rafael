This section presents an overview of the performance of the Data Management System. In particular, it
analysis the efficiency of the implemented DMS as communication system with third party APIs. Figure
5.1 illustrates the response time of the third-party API, as a function of the number of workers (threads)
of the DMS system.
The analysis of this figure shows that if there is a single worker thread, which corresponds to a
serial approach, completing 100 requests takes, approximately 100 seconds. Thus, there is a 1:1 ratio
between requests and number and seconds, for the serial approach. At first, doubling the number of
workers reduces the request time to approximately half. This positive effect from doubling the number of
threads occurs two more times, until there are a total 8 threads making concurrent requests.
Despite this, continuing to increase the number of threads does not have the same positive effect
indefinitely. After reaching a reasonable number of threads, the server through-output stops to increase
in a linear way. In fact, having 32 or 64 threads leads to almost the same response time. This is because
the server becomes overloaded, and is not capable of processing all requests in a truly parallel way.
