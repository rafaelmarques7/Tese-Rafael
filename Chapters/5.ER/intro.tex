In order to validate and evaluate the performance of the developed system, several tests were developed and executed. First, by using a set of benchmarks, the implemented optimization algorithms are tested as to evaluate their overall quality (section \ref{sec:os_eval}). Then, the overall utility of the proposed system is evaluated, by performing a series of tests on the Flying Tourist Problem (section \ref{sec:ftp_eval}). Finally, a thorough comparison with the only known state-of-the-art alternative for the devised FTP is performed (section \ref{sec:nomad}). This is achieved by considering a comprehensive set of real-world multi-city flight problems, using different objective functions as to evaluate the systems performance.

These experiments were executed on a 2.6GHz Intel i7-6700 CPU, with 8GB of RAM, and all the code was developed using the Python3 programming language. 
%In particular, the quality of the obtained solutions are compared with those provided by the \textit{metric nearest neighbor} heuristic, which promotes the nodes proximity to define the traveling route and closely approximates the strategy usually adopted by a human solver.
