The developed applications are divided into two distinct groups: the Client Side Application (CSA), or the User Interface,
and the Server Side Application , or the flight data/optimization API.
Both applications run independently from one another, although the CSA is dependent of the API,
and must communicate with it as to obtain solutions to the user requests.
Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture} introduces the architecture of the system,
aswell as the technologies on which the system relies, which will be adressed in the rest of this section.

The developed applications run on \textit{Heroku}, a Cloud Platform as a service, 
which, upon request, creates two separate servers, one for each application.
The Client Side Application runs a \textit{Node.Js} server, which creates a 
bundle file, that is served to the user, and contains all the necessary information to render the UI, handle the user input logic,
and interact with the API. 
In its turn, the API runs on \textit{Django}, which interacts with the webserver to read the user request, 
and may execute particular intstructions according to the selected route.
