The Server Side Application is the system responsible for producing a solution to a user request, which corresponds to the specific resources, as described in section \ref{sec:api_protocol}. Producing a solution to a user request involves the communication with third party API's, as to obtain the necessary flight data, which is handled by the Data Management System, detailed in section \ref{sec:dms_implementation}. The actual production of a solution is managed by the Optimization System, as described in chapter \ref{chap:os}. The architecture and implementation details of the SSA are presented in section \ref{sec:api_architecture}.
