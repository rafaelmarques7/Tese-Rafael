By following the design proposed in chapter \ref{chap:SD}, this chapter addresses the implementation details of the developed system. This is achieved by first addressing the proposed system as a whole (section \ref{sec:sa_implementation}), followed by an overview of its two main components: the CSA (section \ref{sec:csa_implementation}) and SSA (section \ref{sec:ssa_implementation}).
